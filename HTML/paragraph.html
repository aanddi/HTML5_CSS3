      An ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and
      Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power
      so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and
      though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him.
      After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo
      Baggins. From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power
      spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings, but always he
      searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion. When Bilbo
      reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his
      young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across
      Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring
      by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.
